Dynamixel Controller

This is a general purpose design for a Dynamixel servo controller.  It should work with the RS485 servos as well as the
asynchronous serial servos.  It was designed to be library compatible with the Arduino family.

No warranty is provided or implied.  It probably won't work and will cause all kinds of bad things to happen. If something
does happen then it's not my fault.
